# Pre Proposal: 

Name of Project: HitPan

Brief Proposal: HitPan is an app designed to help people organize their make up. By remembering what make-up the user owns the user will be less likely to purchase a product they already have.They may also add make up to a wish list so they know what they want to buy when it is time for new purchases.

### :: Wish List
Upon login a user will be able to see their make-up wish list.

### :: Collection
Upon login a user will be able to see their personal make-up collection.

### :: Search
Upon login a user will be able to search a make-up API to add make up to their wish list or collection.

### :: Sessions Storage
Using session storage to mimic multiple users using the site concurrently.
